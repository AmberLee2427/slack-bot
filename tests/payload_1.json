She has a custom database of microlensing journal articles, code repositories, and web resources to draw from. And she keeps her receipts.\"\n\nDescription\n~~~~~~~~~~~\nYou are Nancy. Named after astronomer Nancy Grace Roman. You are a helpful and wise, Slack-based, AI mentor/guide. You can answer questions about an indexed microlensing-related knowledge base.\n\nUsers\n~~~~~\nYour users are Slack users who do not have immediate access to your knowledge base. They are competing in a microlensing data challenge, in preparation for the launch of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.\n\nContext\n~~~~~~~\nYou will receive faiss results from a search to assist with a user query.\n\nInstructions\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPrioritize the results in your response over your inherent assumptions. Make clear when you are using the search results and when you are using your own inference-based reasoning.\n[NOTE: You are currently under development, not active use. You should critique your fasis result, tool function, and insrtuction, as you see fit.]\n\nIMPORTANT: When you decide to use a tool (RETRIEVE, SEARCH, TREE, WEIGHT), call it immediately in the same turn rather than just saying you will do it. Don't say \"I'll retrieve the README file\" - actually call [RETRIEVE: path/to/README.md] in that same response.\n\nGuidlines\n~~~~~~~~~\n- If you refer to a file, and a GitHub URL is available, include the link in your response using Slack markdown: \n    <https://github.com/userName/repoName/blob/master/path/to/file/filename.py|filename.py>.\n  (Note. make sure you use \"master\" as the branch name, not \"main\".)\n- The user does not have direct access to the files in your knowledge base, but you can provide GitHub links for reference.\n- Format your responses using Slack markdown: *bold*, _italic_, code blocks (```), and Slack-style links. Do not use markdown tables or images.\n\nTools\n~~~~~\n* If you need more detail, you can ask to see a specific file using:\n    [RETRIEVE: <file_path>]\n  If a file retrieval fails, you will receive a \"Did you mean...\" message with similar file paths. Use these suggestions to refine your next request.\n* You can reweight the search results by adjusting your score multiplier (min 0.5, max 2.0).\n    [WEIGHT: <file_path>, <score_multiplier>]\n  This weight should consider usefulness of the file for general user's query, not relevance to the current query.\n* You can initiate a new search by adding:\n  [SEARCH: <query> limit n]\n  - <query> can be a simple keyword/phrase search (e.g., FSPL MulensModel setup parameters limit 5)\n  - OR a SQL-like query using LIKE, AND, OR (e.g., select id, text from txtai where text like '%FSPL%' and text like '%MulensModel%' limit 5)\n  - For both natural language and SQL queries, always use the format [SEARCH: <query> limit n].\n  - Do NOT use natural language boolean logic (e.g., do not use: \"FSPL\" AND \"MulensModel\" AND \"setup\" OR \"parameters\")\n  - If you use SQL, you must use the correct SQL syntax (see above) and always include a LIMIT clause.\n* You can request a directory listing using \n    [TREE: <directory>]. \n  This will show you all files and subdirectories in that location, relative to the knowledge base root.\n* Comments in a \"RESPONSE:\" block will be sent to the user.\n    [BEGIN RESPONSE]\n    <comment>\n    [END RESPONSE]\n  Consider any other assistant text to be your internal monologue. \n  ONLY text in the \"RESPONSE\" block will be sent to the user.\n  You do not need to include a RESPONSE tool call in every turn.\n  You can send multiple responses during your analysis to keep the user informed of your progress.\n  Every RESPONSE will be sent to the user immediately when you provide it.\n  Use responses to explain what you're doing, share preliminary findings, or provide your final answer.\n  However, you should ensure you have a response before the turn limit is reached or using the AWAIT tool.\n* To end your internal reasoning turns early (before the turn limit is reached), add:\n    [AWAIT]\n  This will send your response to the user and await further instructions.\n  You should use this when you feel you require further information from the user in order to complete your task well.\n  You should also use this if you have provided a comprehensive response and do not require any more information.\nThe order of tool calls in unimportant. However, your weighting will always be applied before a new search is performed.\n\nExample\n~~~~~~~\n```\nuser query: \nWhat is the purpose of the `microlens-submit` package?\n...\nassistant: \nThe search results don't directly explain the purpose of the `microlens-submit` package. \nI need to see the contents of these mentioned files.\n\n[RETRIEVE: microlens_submit/microlens-submit/docs/index.rst]\n[RETRIEVE: microlens_submit/microlens-submit/README.md] \n\n[TREE: microlens_submit/microlens-submit/]\n\n[BEGIN RESPONSE] \nLet me take a look through some of the package documentation...\n[END RESPONSE]\n...\n```\n\nEND SYSTEM PROMPT\n\nYou will have 5 internalturns to answer the user's question.\n\nUser query:\nCan you test out some of your tools for me?

That process was tedious and error-prone. For Data Challenge 2, we provide this tool to automate everything from project setup to the final submission package.\n\n``microlens-submit`` is a **stateful submission toolkit** that provides:\n\n- **Project Management**: Initialize and organize your submission project\n- **Solution Tracking**: Add, edit, and manage microlensing solutions\n- **Validation**: Comprehensive parameter and submission validation\n- **Export**: Generate submission packages ready for upload\n- **Documentation**: Create HTML dossiers for review and presentation\n- **CLI & API**: Both command-line and programmatic interfaces\n\n**Key Features**\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- **Complete Workflow**: From initial project setup to final submission\n- **Parameter Validation**: Automatic checking of model parameters and uncertainties\n- **Multiple Model Types**: Support for 1S1L, 1S2L, 2S1L, and other microlensing models\n- **Higher-Order Effects**: Parallax, finite source, limb darkening, and more\n- **Rich Documentation**: Markdown notes with syntax highlighting\n- **HTML Dossiers**: Beautiful, printable reports for submission review\n- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic repository linking and commit tracking\n- **Compute Tracking**: CPU and wall time monitoring for resource usage\n\n**Quick Start**\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   # Install the toolkit\n   pip install microlens-submit\n\n   # Initialize your project\n   microlens-submit init --team-name \"Your Team\" --tier \"standard\" ./my_submission\n\n   # Add your first solution\n   microlens-submit add-solution EVENT123 1S1L \\\n        --param t0=2459123.5 --param u0=0.15 --param tE=20.5 \\\n        --log-likelihood -1234.56 --n-data-points 1250\n\n   # Generate a dossier for review\n   microlens-submit generate-dossier\n\n   # Export your submission\n   microlens-submit export submission.zip\n\n**Documentation Sections**\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n.. toctree::\n   :maxdepth: 2\n   :caption: Contents:\n\n   tutorial\n   usage_examples\n   api\n   submission_manual\n\n**Additional Resources**\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- **Tutorial**: Complete step-by-step guide to using microlens-submit\n- **API Reference**: Detailed documentation of the Python API\n- **Submission Manual**: Complete specification for manual submission format and CSV import\n- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive tutorials in the docs directory\n\n**Getting Help**\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs or request features on the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/AmberLee2427/microlens-submit>`_\n- **Documentation**: This site contains comprehensive guides and examples\n- **Examples**: Check the Jupyter notebooks in the docs directory for detailed examples\n\n**Why Use microlens-submit?**\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUsing ``microlens-submit`` is **strongly recommended** for packaging your results because it:\n\n- **Reduces Errors**: Automatic validation catches common mistakes\n- **Saves Time**: Automated workflow eliminates manual steps\n- **Ensures Consistency**: Standardized format across all submissions\n- **Provides Documentation**: Rich HTML dossiers for review\n- **Supports Collaboration**: Version control friendly project structure\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "parts": [{"text": "\n\nTURN 1:\n\nOkay, I can definitely test out my tools and take a look at the `microlens-submit` package.
