Installation
============

This part of the documentation helps you install Slack Machine with the least amount of friction,
or the most amount of flexibility.

Installing the easy way with pip
--------------------------------

Slack Machine is published to the `Python package index`_ so you can easily install Slack Machine using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install slack-machine

It is **strongly recommended** that you install ``slack-machine`` inside a `virtual environment`_!

.. _Python package index: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/slack-machine
.. _virtual environment: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

Installing from source
----------------------

If you are adventurous, want to modify the core of your Slack Machine instance and want maximum
flexibility, you can also install from source. This way, you can enjoy the latest and greatest!

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git://github.com/DandyDev/slack-machine.git

Or, download the `tarball <https://github.com/DandyDev/slack-machine/tarball/master>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -OL https://github.com/DandyDev/slack-machine/tarball/master
    # optionally, zipball is also available (for Windows users).

Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your own Python
package, or install it into your site-packages easily:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd slack-machine
    $ pip install .
