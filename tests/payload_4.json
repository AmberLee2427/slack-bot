Clarity is needed to formulate a useful response.\n*   **Constraints:** Adhere to the 5-turn limit.

Assume the user has not yet clarified the meaning. Therefore provide the general answer with all context.\n*   **Rationale:** Even without explicit clarification, it's likely the user means a network ping, given the environment. Providing a general answer enables a prompt response. However, keep it general enough, so it could fit a different \"ping\" as well.\n*   **Constraints:**  Continue adhering to the 5-turn limit. Acknowledge no additional search results. Keep the response concise and avoid overly technical jargon.  Acknowledge the original query of \"ping\".\n\n"}]}, {"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "\n\nTURN 1 REQUESTS:\n\n\n\nTURN 2 REQUESTS:\n\n\n\nTURN 3 REQUESTS:\n\n"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "parts": [{"text": "\n\nTURN 4:\n\nTURN 4:\n\nHere's the breakdown for Turn 3:\n\n**TURN 3 REQUESTS:**\n\n*   **Action:** Continue elaborating on the answer begun in Turn 2. Offer a specific example/scenario relating to the \"ping\" concept (e.g., \"You might ping a website to see if it's online\"). Offer a brief summary that includes a question.\n*   **Rationale:** Building on the previous turn, a practical example will help the user understand the concept more clearly, even if they're unfamiliar with the term. A question will help determine whether further clarification is necessary.\n*   **Constraints:**  Keep the response within the 5-turn limit. The lack of search results remains a constraint. The answer still must fit any possible understanding of \"ping\".
